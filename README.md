## Run Locally

### Layout Approach:
The product page uses a column layout where the product image and details are side-by-side on larger screens. Components are broken down into reusable units like ProductCard and VariantsDropdown to promote maintainability and code reuse.

### Responsiveness Considerations:
The layout adapts for smaller screens by stacking the columns vertically using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system (col-md-6 and col-sm-12). Additionally, certain UI elements like the similar products carousel are hidden on small devices to optimize usability and performance.
